## Quick Start

### Continuous Training Mode

Train the network continuously (runs forever until stopped):

```bash
# Continue from saved checkpoint
python continuous_train.py

# Start with fresh brain
python continuous_train.py --new

# Test only (no training)
python continuous_train.py --test
```

**Features:**
- Auto-saves every 100 batches
- Prints progress every 10 batches
- Press Ctrl+C to stop safely (auto-saves on exit)
- Network learns both addition (0-6 range) and division (0.1-3 range)
- **TensorBoard logging** for real-time visualization

### TensorBoard Visualization

Monitor training in real-time with TensorBoard:

```bash
# Option 1: Use the launch script (Windows)
.\launch_tensorboard.ps1

# Option 2: Run manually
tensorboard --logdir=runs

# Option 3: With specific port
tensorboard --logdir=runs --port=6006

# Then open http://localhost:6006 in your browser
```

**Available Metrics:**
- **Training/** - Reward, Error, Plateau detection, Reward variance
- **Network/** - Total neurons, Total layers, Per-layer neuron counts
- **Modifications/** - Modification events, types, and success rates
- **Test/** - Addition/Division/Overall accuracy

Each training run creates a timestamped log directory in `runs/`.

**Tips:**
- Run TensorBoard in a separate terminal while training
- Metrics update in real-time as the network trains
- Compare multiple runs to see which configurations work best
- Plateau detection shows when the network gets stuck

### Configuration

Edit `continuous_train.py` to adjust:
- `SAMPLES_PER_BATCH = 50` - Samples per training batch
- `SAVE_INTERVAL_BATCHES = 100` - How often to auto-save
- `MAX_DIGIT = 3` - Maximum digit for math problems (0-3 range)
- `PRINT_INTERVAL = 10` - How often to print stats
- `PLATEAU_WINDOW = 50` - Window for detecting stagnation
- `PLATEAU_THRESHOLD = 0.005` - Variance threshold for plateau detection
- `STUCK_THRESHOLD = 3` - Consecutive plateau detections = stuck

### 5. Reward System
- **Simplified Scoring** - Returns +1 (good), 0 (neutral), or -1 (bad)
- **Error-Based Classification** - Compares prediction error to target magnitude
- **Threshold Levels:**
  - Excellent: <5% error → +1
  - Good: <15% error → +1
  - Okay: <30% error → 0
  - Poor: <50% error → 0
  - Bad: >50% error → -1
  - Terrible: >100% error → -1

## Implementation Notes

### Tag System
The network uses 4D tag vectors for neuron identity and routing. Tags enable selective activation where neurons only fire when their functional tag matches the input tag with sufficient similarity (threshold 0.5). This creates sparse, efficient activation patterns.

### Activation Flow
1. Input `x` converted to tag via random projection (for neuron initialization)
2. All neurons in each layer activate and compute output
3. Layer aggregates outputs from all neurons
4. Output passed to next layer or final prediction

### Learning Process
1. **Forward Pass**: All neurons activate with tanh (hidden) or linear (output)
2. **Loss Computation**: MSE between prediction and target
3. **Reward Calculation**: +1 (good), 0 (neutral), or -1 (bad) based on error
4. **Backward Pass**: Gradients computed and clipped (±5.0)
5. **Weight Update**: All active neurons update with learning_rate=0.1
6. **Weight Clipping**: Weights clipped to ±20.0 range
7. **Structure Check**: Every 5000 steps, meta-learner suggests modifications

### Meta-Learning System
- 2-layer MLP predicts modification success
- Trained on historical modification outcomes
- **15 Features**: reward, error, trends, network size, modification type, **plateau_detected**
- Plateau feature signals when stuck in local minimum
- Learns from experience which strategies work when stuck vs normal learning
- Selects from 6 strategies: add neuron, remove neuron, add layer, remove layer, rewire, adjust thresholds
- Trains every 500 steps on accumulated modification history
- **No random exploration** - all decisions based on learned patterns

### Modification Strategies
1. **Add Neuron** - Adds neuron to layer with lowest average reward
2. **Remove Neuron** - Removes neuron with lowest performance from largest layer
3. **Add Layer** - Inserts new layer between existing layers
4. **Remove Layer** - Removes layer with lowest average performance
5. **Rewire** - Reconnects neurons between adjacent layers
6. **Adjust Learning** - Modifies per-neuron learning rates

### Checkpoint System
- Auto-saves every 100 batches to `network_checkpoint.pkl`
- Includes full network state (weights, structure, history)
- Can resume training from any checkpoint
- Test mode loads checkpoint for evaluation

## Example Training Output

```
Batch 10, Step 500: Reward=-1.00, Error=56.23, pred=9.87, target=12.45, input=[7, 5, 0, 0]

```

## Troubleshooting

### Network predictions stuck at constant value
- Check learning rate (should be ~0.1 for this task)
- Verify gradient clipping not too tight (±5.0 recommended)
- Ensure weight clipping allows sufficient range (±20.0)
- Confirm activation functions: tanh for hidden, linear for output
- Check that tag-based selective activation is enabled (only neurons with matching tags should fire)

### Network exploding to large values
- Reduce learning rate (try 0.01 or 0.001)
- Tighten gradient clipping (try ±2.0 or ±1.0)
- Add output clipping in predict() method
- Use bounded activation (tanh instead of ReLU)

### Structure not evolving
- Reduce check_structure_every (try 1000-3000 steps)
- Verify rollback is not too aggressive
- Check reward thresholds for growth/pruning
- Ensure meta-learner has training data

### Memory/performance issues
- Reduce max_layers or max_neurons_per_layer
- Increase check_structure_every for less frequent modifications
- Clear modification history periodically

## Theory and Inspiration
